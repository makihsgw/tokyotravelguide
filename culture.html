    <h2> Religion </h2>
        <h3> <img src="img/tea.jpg"> Religion in Japan works as a moral code and is a way of living, almost indistinguishable from Japanese social and cultural values. Ideas from Shintoism and Buddism are intertwined and defines Japanese identity more than spirituality, helping strengthen family and community ties. </h3>
        
        <p>Shintoism is Japan’s indigenous spirituality and it is believed that every living thing in nature contains gods. Shinto principles can be seen throughout Japanese culture, where nature and the turning of the seasons are cherished. This is reflected in arts such as bonsai, Japanese garden design and the annual celebration of sakura (cherry blossom). </p>

        <p>On the other hand, Zen Buddhism concerned with the soul and the afterlife is rooted deep within Japanese culture. Japanese gardens are full of religious significance; pathways lead to enlightenment, whilst the soil represents the fertility and nurturing nature of Buddha's mind, and tea ceremony is a ritual based on the prepatation and presentation of a powdered green tea.</p>
        <div class="space">
            <p>Religion is rarely discussed in everyday life and the majority of Japanese people do not worship regularly. However most people turn to religious rituals in birth, marriage and death and take part in spiritual matsuri (festivals) throughout the year. </p>

    <h2> Kimono </h2>
        <h4> <img src="img/maiko.jpg"> Kimono, which translates to “clothing” in Japanese, is a traditional Japanese garment which were worn by everyone in Japan until the mid 19th century. In modern day, it is worn only sparingly or during special occasions such as weddings, tea ceremonies, formal traditional events and funerals. </h4>
    
        <p>Women’s kimono is traditionally made of silk, decorated with techniques including embroidery, yuzen painting and dyeing. Men’s kimono usually has more subdued colors and are typically made from matte fabrics. </p>
        <div class="space">
            <p>In recent years, kimono rental services for tourists have become very popular especially at tourist attractions such as Asakusa in Tokyo and Gion, Kyoto’s geisha district. </p>
